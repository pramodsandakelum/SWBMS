♻️ Smart Waste Bin Management System – AI Predictor








📖 Overview

The Smart Waste Bin Management System (SWBMS) AI Predictor is an intelligent solution designed to revolutionize waste management in urban and rural environments.
It leverages IoT, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics to:

Predict waste bin fill levels in real time.

Optimize waste collection routes.

Reduce overflowing bins and improve cleanliness.

Support sustainable urban living with data-driven decisions.

🚀 Features

✅ AI-based prediction model (LightGBM + Neural Networks)
✅ Streamlit dashboard for visualization & predictions
✅ Real-time monitoring (IoT integration ready)
✅ Smart alerts & notifications
✅ Scalable architecture for city-wide deployment
✅ Energy & cost savings for municipalities

📊 Dataset

Collected from simulated IoT sensors and real waste bin monitoring datasets.

Includes:

Timestamp, Location, Waste Type

Fill level %, Collection frequency

Overflow events

💡 How It Works

Data Preprocessing – clean, normalize, and engineer features.

Model Training – ML ensemble predicts waste levels & collection needs.

Visualization – Streamlit app displays predictions and 3D bin status.

Deployment – ready for cloud / local server integration.
